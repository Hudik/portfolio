            <h4>Assignment</h4>
            <p>User experience (UX) refers to a person's entire experience using a particular product, system or service. The first requirement for a great user experience is to meet the exact needs for the usage of a product or a service, without fuss or bother. To achieve this, users must have all necessary information for their task without being overloaded, not having unnecessary actions, calculation or having to recall. Interaction techniques must be familiar and behave along expectation, errors must be prevented. If users make errors, there must be easy way to recover them.</p>
            <h4>Wireframes</h4>
            <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups of how the screen estate could be used.</p>

                As part of a PoC for a DMS (Document Management System) I conducted a field study that surfaced very unexpected findings.
                Based on those we created wireframes and used them in a Usability Test.<br />
                Programming the proof of concept was then a lot more streamlined due to the UX deliverables.

            <p>Die Führung der Workshops war sehr gut und die Resultate zeigen, dass der eingeschlagenen Weg richtig war. Es war spannend zu Beobachten wie die Teilnehmer die fiktive Oberfläche des Papierprototyps annahmen und ihre Aufgaben lösten. Ich bin der Meinung solche Workshops müssten in Zukunft in die Organisationsprojekte einfliessen und zum Standard gehören.</p>

Auch wenn er uns dann immer alle Rahmen aus den Interfaces streicht. Dass er seine Wurzeln in der Entwicklung hat macht das Zusammenarbeiten für uns einfacher, weil wir dieselbe Sprache sprechen.</p>

        <p>User experience (UX) refers to a person's entire experience using a particular product, system or service. The first requirement for a great user experience is to meet the exact needs for the usage of a product or a service, without fuss or bother. To achieve this, users must have all <strong>necessary information</strong> for their task without being overloaded, not having unnecessary actions, calculation or having to recall. Interaction techniques must be familiar and behave along expectation, errors must be prevented. If users make errors, there must be easy way to recover them. When usage is frequent, product or service must provide shortcut. Users need to have feedbacks, feel in control and know what is going on at all time.User experience includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as the wider usage context in which they can be found.</p>

          <p>Die Führung der Workshops war sehr gut und die Resultate zeigen, dass der eingeschlagenen Weg richtig war. Es war spannend zu Beobachten wie die Teilnehmer die fiktive Oberfläche des Papierprototyps annahmen und ihre Aufgaben lösten. Ich bin der Meinung solche Workshops müssten in Zukunft in die Organisationsprojekte einfliessen und zum Standard gehören.</p>
