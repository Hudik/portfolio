                Our Client was looking to build a versatile extranet where both existing and potential clients as well as service technitians could access their product catalog and services.<br />
                What looked like a simple task in the beginning turned out to be way more complex due to very different persona requirements.

            <h4>Assignment</h4>
            <p>User experience (UX) refers to a person's entire experience using a particular product, system or service. The first requirement for a great user experience is to meet the exact needs for the usage of a product or a service, without fuss or bother. To achieve this, users must have all necessary information for their task without being overloaded, not having unnecessary actions, calculation or having to recall. Interaction techniques must be familiar and behave along expectation, errors must be prevented. If users make errors, there must be easy way to recover them.</p>
            <h4>Wireframes</h4>
            <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups of how the screen estate could be used.</p>

                As part of a PoC for a DMS (Document Management System) I conducted a field study that surfaced very unexpected findings.
                Based on those we created wireframes and used them in a Usability Test.<br />
                Programming the proof of concept was then a lot more streamlined due to the UX deliverables.

            <p>Die Führung der Workshops war sehr gut und die Resultate zeigen, dass der eingeschlagenen Weg richtig war. Es war spannend zu Beobachten wie die Teilnehmer die fiktive Oberfläche des Papierprototyps annahmen und ihre Aufgaben lösten. Ich bin der Meinung solche Workshops müssten in Zukunft in die Organisationsprojekte einfliessen und zum Standard gehören.</p>

        <p>Currently based in Lucerne, Switzerland, I'm a UX Specialist and Designer at <a href="http://www.ioz.ch" target="_blank">IOZ AG</a> where we build custom SharePoint Platforms. As I'm the only one doing this sort of work my responsabilities range from <strong>producing custom Designs</strong> in Photoshop to <strong>planning and facilitating UX studies and workshops</strong> with our clients and introducing and <strong>establishing the UX principles</strong> with the various stakeholders within our company.</p>
        <p>I've been floating through the web cosmos since the age of 14 (that's more then half of my life) as a graphic designer, front- and backend developer and recently as the UX lead. Throughout my career I've been interested in building easy to use products and prioritizing the user's needs. Back in the days that was an unusual view as things just had to work to be approved by clients. So once UX gained traction I finally found a name (or methodology) to express my desires and since have focused on this creative yet analytic discipline.</p>
        <p>On a more personal note: I'm married to my lovely Wife and a father of two sweet little princesses. I try to spend most of my free time with my family and together we enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/overlandfamily/" target="_blank">exploring Switzerland</a>. Every now and then I get to be <a href="https://500px.com/timschoch" class="icon500px" target="_blank">creative with my camera</a> or we <a href="http://silviaundtim.ch/" target="_blank">travel the world</a> (our german travel diary).</p>

        <p>User experience (UX) refers to a person's entire experience using a particular product, system or service. The first requirement for a great user experience is to meet the exact needs for the usage of a product or a service, without fuss or bother. To achieve this, users must have all <strong>necessary information</strong> for their task without being overloaded, not having unnecessary actions, calculation or having to recall. Interaction techniques must be familiar and behave along expectation, errors must be prevented. If users make errors, there must be easy way to recover them. When usage is frequent, product or service must provide shortcut. Users need to have feedbacks, feel in control and know what is going on at all time.User experience includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as the wider usage context in which they can be found.</p>

          <p>Die Führung der Workshops war sehr gut und die Resultate zeigen, dass der eingeschlagenen Weg richtig war. Es war spannend zu Beobachten wie die Teilnehmer die fiktive Oberfläche des Papierprototyps annahmen und ihre Aufgaben lösten. Ich bin der Meinung solche Workshops müssten in Zukunft in die Organisationsprojekte einfliessen und zum Standard gehören.</p>
