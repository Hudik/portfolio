I care about others achieving their goals and having a good time while doing so. To design usable products I put myself in the shoes of the user and take over their view. The Double Diamond process shown in the graphic above is a way of tackling projects in an informed manner and was created by <a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/" target=_blank>The British Design Council</a>. In short it aims to first understand before implementing a solution. You can find an excellent summary on <a href=https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/double-diamond target=_blank>ThoughtWorks</a>.</p> <p>In terms of UX methods I use <strong>Interviews</strong>, <strong>Personas</strong>, <strong>Field Studies</strong>, <strong>Design Workshops</strong> and <strong>Brainstorming</strong> to gather knowledge.</p> <p>With that understanding I use <strong>Story Boarding</strong>, <strong>Card Sorting and Tree Testing</strong>, <strong>Wireframes and Mockups</strong> and <strong>Low-Fi Prototypes</strong> in <strong>Lab Studies</strong> to propose practical solutions.</p> <p>During the implementation I <strong>design the Interface</strong>, keep <strong>in touch with the devs</strong> and test <strong>High-Fi Prototypes</strong> in <strong>Lab Studies</strong>.</p> <p>Because I rarely get the freedom (read: budget) to run a perfect all-inclusive UX scenario I choose which methods will provide the best results with a reasonable effort depending on the type of project, the scale and the budget. With smaller projects I might just do a stakeholder interview, a short persona workshop and a Lab Study on the current intranet while bigger projects will have prototypes, can be iterative and I usually try to steer those client towards agile methods instead of a single big bang release.</p> <p>You can find more on how I apply these methods in practical work examples provided in the next chapter:</p> </section>   <section class=waypoint id=work> <h2>Work</h2>  <article class=lundg> <header> <figure> <img src=images/lundg/paper-prototype.png alt=Landis+Gyr> </figure> <div class=info> <h3>Landis+Gyr</h3> <ul class=methods> <li class="method personas">Personas</li> <li class="method paperprototype">Paper Prototype</li> <li class="method labstudy">Lab Study</li> <li class="method workshops">Workshops</li> <li class="method wireframes">Wireframes</li> <li class="method mockups">Mockups</li> </ul> <p class=lead> Our Client was looking to build a versatile extranet where both existing and potential clients as well as service technicians could access their product catalogue, documentation, training and collaboration workspaces.<br> What looked like a simple task in the beginning turned out to be way more complex due to very different persona requirements. <a href=# class=more>read more</a> <a href=# class=less>read less</a> </p> </div> </header> <div class=details> <h4>Assignment</h4> <p>Landis+Gyr is the global industry leader in metering solutions for electricity, gas, heat/cold and water and a pioneer in the field of smart grids. To further improve collaboration with their clients they hired us to build an extranet where clients could use workspaces to exchange documents, access the product catalog and get further information or software updates. The UX study took place in the pre-project and our goal was to create a basic understanding of how the extranet would be structured and what areas needed further investigation during the project. The UX time budget was roughly a week.</p> <h4>Kick Off Workshop</h4> <p>In our initial workshop we defined the exact goals of the study and showed the client how the proposed paper prototype will work towards those goals. The first step to understanding the clients needs was to map out what content the extranet would have and how the user story of collaborating would look like. Also in this first day we created about a dozen personas and prioritized them for release v1. Somewhere between mapping out the processes and creating the personas it got clear that this extranet will include way more roles with very divergent requirements than the client had expected and that it would be a complex task to make this broad range of content easy to use.</p> <p class=small>Unfortunatly I can't show you any deliverables from this, but there are more screenshots and photos in the following steps.</p> <h4>Basic Mockups</h4> <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups early on. They actet more as a discussion starter in the next workshop than an actuall deliverable and proved to be very helpful as the client could visualize and understand how screen estate is managed. As the basic design for the extranet was already done prior to our UX project I wasn't worried to already use it in the header and footers in this early concept stage.</p> <figure> <img src=images/lundg/wireframes.png> <figcaption>These wireframes show a layout concept for the workspaces. On the <strong>left</strong> you can see the first attempt at role based content as it would show different actions to internal or external users.<br>The <strong>right</strong> side shows the home page of a single workspace and its overview page - nothing to spectacular there except for the short introductionary video on how to use workspaces. This level of on boarding is actually quite rare on intranets.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Paper Prototype</h4> <p>After the content map was sorted out and the wireframes where done I created a paper prototype. It consisted of roughly 20 screens, each with its own various bits and pieces that could be altered using post-it notes. Between each participant we discussed the findings and iterated on the prototype. Some areas we investigated where the general discoverability of products, two navigations concepts, a way to favourite products and alterations of the starting page and product detail page.</p> <figure> <img src=images/lundg/paper-prototype.png> <figcaption>I acted as the computer changing the paper screen infront of the user while the rest of the team was observing and taking notes.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Role Based Navigation</h4> <p>One key finding we learned from the usability testings was that the main personas had fundamentally different requirements regarding the use of products on the extranet. On one side there where personas that had access to alot (or all) of the products (that would be over a hundred, not even counting country specific versions of the same product) and would use a wide number of them in their daily work. Most of those users regulary use workspaces too. A typical role for this persona could be an internal project manager or a sales manager at a regional partner company. They most likely needed some form of "last accessed products" and a way to quickly get all used products for a specific project, client or offer.</p> <p>On the other hand there where a lot uf users who only have access to a limited amout of products - roughly between ten and thirty. Out of this collection only a subset would be relevant to them on a daily basis. This would be true for technical support staff mainting the producs on site. These personas would be more interested in a "my favourite products" option with a list to access all the products and software used by their company.</p> <p>Even the type of information displayed for each product changes depending on the role. For example a sales manager would be interested in the general information on the product, compatibility issues, pricing and technical specs for his engineering team while a service technitian on site needs nothing of that but has to be able to quickly access the manuals on his mobile device.</p> <p>Because only the usability study was included in the budget we created the example below of how a role based mega dropdown for the navigation could behave and proposed to do some further investigation on this topic bevor implementing it on the extranet.</p> <figure> <img src=images/lundg/contextual-navigation.png> <figcaption>Role based mockups for the mega menu showing different quick access lists for internal or external users.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Responsive Design</h4> <p>One design requirement was that it had to be responsive. Although this wasn't part of the UX study I included the following mockups to show how the personas influenced our design decissions. On the desktop (left) the highest priority personas are interested in the product information itself, not so much in getting related content like software updates or manuals. As a result 60% of the screen is used to presented that information.</p> <p>The product information section on the mobile view (right) is collapsed to only a couple lines of teaser text because that information isn't as relevant to the highest priority mobile users (the technical staff on site). By tapping on the "more details" button the whole text can be expanded if needed. The same progressive disclosure method is used for the additional resources each product has by using an accordion. This layout gives the technician on site a very streamlined experience:</p> <ol> <li>Above the fold mainly the product name, product number and images are shown. This is to ensure the users visually confirms that the physical product he or she is currently working on matches that one currently opened in the browser. If the products match, the user can swipe down to proceed.</li> <li>If unsure, a quick read of the product description can point out whether they're on the right page or not. As this is usually not needed this content is mostly collapsed.</li> <li>Using the accordion in the third section the user then has direct access to software udpates, product specs, manuals or contact informations.</li> </ol> <p>Because these are mostly gas or electricity items it was important to ensure the user selects the right products. We could have rearanged the additional resources on mobiles to be shown above the fold, but this would be counterproductive.</p> <figure> <img src=images/lundg/responsive.png> <figcaption>The two layouts show how the second column containing the product description gets alot more space on the desktop (left) then on the mobile page (right).</figcaption> </figure> </div> </article>   <article class=mueag> <header> <figure><img src=images/mueag/mueag.png alt="Alfred Müller AG"></figure> <div class=info> <h3>Alfred Müller AG</h3> <ul class=methods> <li class="method personas">Personas</li> <li class="method fieldstudy">Field Study</li> <li class="method paperprototype">Paper Prototype</li> <li class="method labstudy">Lab Study</li> <li class="method workshops">Workshops</li> <li class="method wireframes">Wireframes</li> <li class="method mockups">Mockups</li> </ul> <p class=lead> As part of a PoC for a Document Management System I conducted a field study that surfaced very unexpected findings. Based on those we created wireframes and used them in a Usability Test.<br> Programming the proof of concept was a lot more streamlined because of the UX deliverables. <a href=# class=more>read more</a> <a href=# class=less>read less</a> </p> </div> </header> <div class=details> <h4>Assignment</h4> <p>Our client is a prime contractor in the real estate industry and had the problem that their SharePoint intranet and collaboration platforms where rarely used by their staff despite good training efforts. As a result a common way of handling documents was missing. As a proof of concept we where tasked to test if it would be possible to build a usefull DMS with SharePoint as a platform. As the first version had failed one of the main areas of focus for the second rendition was usability. Parallel to our project the client replaced the old silo based file classification system with a modern process based approach.</p> <p>Our study initially consisted of a two day field study to gather basic knowledge on the document life cycle throught the different departments and another two days conducting a lab study using a paper prototype. Due to the summer holidays approaching the time frame was only two weeks from the first day of the study to the finished report. Because of this we agreed on a lean approach where findings where saved as PBIs and only noted down breifly for later reference along with images of our diagrams and findings from the study. Our final deliverable was a full backlog and a common understanding on the project team, summarized in a very short report mainly focussing on high level findings both for the current and further releases.</p> <h4>Kick Off Workshop</h4> <p>We collaboratively created the basic personas using lean characters, set out a detailed road map for the studies and selected 18 test users from all departments and all ages. For the studies we had a permanent team consisting of the project managers and myself and additional members (the information architect and our lead developer) that accompanied us for at least one day during the study.</p> <p>The Client then had two weeks to fix four dates where all team members and the users could attend. (Doing this in only two weeks is actually pretty darn good)</p> <p>The two main personas we created where the "dossier internal" and the "dossier external". The first is mainly working with a few dossiers and has a deep knowledge of them (real estate agents or construction site supervisors) while the second use a wide variety of dossiers but with a very specific subset of folders (marketing or team leaders).</p> <h4>Field Study</h4> <figure> <img src=images/mueag/field-study.png> <figcaption>E-Mails and printed documents play a crucial role in this clients document handling.</figcaption> </figure> <p>We spent two days watching the users working with documents and interviewed them on the current document life cycles. The results where anything but what we had expected: For most of the users E-Mail and MS Outlook where their main way of handling files. They would send E-Mails back and forth and keep copies of often used documents in their inbox or save them locally. Of course alot of those copies wheren't up do date anymore. Some of the teams would collaborate on file shares, others would print out all relevant informations and store them in binders specific to the property they belong to.</p> <p>Now you might think this is a very unsecure way to handle important data. But after a closer look it was just the most efficient way to both collaborate and keep track of the tasks at hand. The inbox and calendar functioned as the todo list, while the important documents got saved to a mail folder and could easiely be accessed and searched form a single interface. As a property was usually assigned to only a single person the printed out paper was a very fast and intuitive way of skimming through a large set of content.</p> <h4>Analyzing the field study</h4> <figure> <img src=images/mueag/affinity-diagram.png> <figcaption>We used affinity diagraming to distill the findings into insights</figcaption> </figure> <p>The key take aways where file handling, template management and the search needed major improvements. After two days we knew that we had to come up with a very good solution to outperform the current methodes. Afterall - <strong>our tool had tobeat Windows Explorer</strong>.</p> <p>Because it would never be possible to make our tool faster to use then Windows Explorer (read: less clicks) we had to add real value in order to make our users happy and drive user adoption. Our solution combines the new process based information architecture with an optimized template management. Every dossiers has a well defined state within the business process map. And each step in that process has a defined number of templates that are regularly used. By adding some logic to the dossiers and the subfolders it contains we can enhance the <strong>add new document</strong> button to not only show a selection of what document type (word, excel, powerpoint) can be created, but suggest the proper templates to the user.</p> <p>But we're not done yet! For the sake of this example let us assume Mike, a construction site manager, has to create a new meeting protocol every week. Expanding on the idea of leading the user proactively... he doesn't care about <strong>what template</strong> to choose, he just wants to create that specific protocol. So why does he have to select a rather abstract template at all? Why not just let him select the end result he wants to create and handle the template selection on the backend? Because those protocols are stored in a dedicated folder, whe know exactly what Mike wants to create when he hits the [new] button on that folder.<br> Time shift - Months later when the construction is finished and Mike has to add a final protocoll to the same folder where he added the weekly protocolls. Now instead of having to know which exact protocol template he should use, he just selects to add a final protocol from the [new] menu. In the background our tool chooses the correct template which might or might not be the same as for the weekly protocols. Mike couldn't be bothered less because his team manager has wired up all the correct templates.</p> <p>If you wish you can take this even one step further and add some automatization to the dossiers. Milestone documents like the final protocoll from above could trigger actions. This was definitly not part of the scope for this project, but it is important to have a vision: how about a dashboard showing all the project states and what mile stones are missing before the project can proceed to the next phase. Or once the final protocoll was added send marketing a notice that the real estate will become available on the market within the next six months so they can start to prepare the sales material. The possibilities would be endless, but making that system user friendly and easy to maintain is definitly a project of its own. So, back to our current project...</p> <h4>Paper prototype lab tudy</h4> <p>For the paper prototype we designed an three column layout where each column serves the same dedicated purpose throughout the UI.</p> <figure> <img src=images/mueag/prototype.png> <figcaption>A sketch of the three columns.</figcaption> </figure> <ol> <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> The user selects the dossier and the subfolders, making use of a pattern they already know from Windows Explorer.</li> <li><strong>Files:</strong> This column shows the files matching the current navigation selection. Inline search and filters allow the user to narrow down the list as those folders sometimes contain a large number of files.</li> <li><strong>Preview:</strong> Do you remember flicking through the binders full of printed documents we observed in the field study? Turns out alot of the work they have to do is compare invoices and requests to protocolls and contracts. By providing a large preview of the selected file the user can now quickly skim through the digital documents and move back and forth without actively having to open the files like they would in Windows Explorer. <strong>Now this is added value right here!</strong></li> </ol> <p>The Prototype had other neet little features too, like a naming assistant that automatically udpates timestamps. So if a user duplicates the file "2015-04 construction site protocoll.docx" it would suggest "<strong>2016-07</strong> construction site protocoll.docx" as the new name and change the date to the current month. The same works when the users creates a new file where it would combine the current date with the file name specified in the process map.</p> <figure> <img src=images/mueag/mueag.png> <figcaption>Myself, the client project manager and our lead dev working on the prototype (ltr).</figcaption> </figure> <p>After each participant we had a one hour break that we wanted to use to iterate on the prototype. But because we had done a thorough job in the field study and when designing the prototype, most of the participants where so successful at completing the tasks that we had a hard time finding parts we could further improve. We did how ever add another persona as we felt sporadic users had very different needs from our two main personas and needed to be catered for sperately.</p> <h4>Annotated Mockups</h4> <figure> <img src=images/mueag/mockups.png> <figcaption>The green blobs describe parts of the interface that will be included in the poc while the orange ones aren't.</figcaption> </figure> <p>After conducting the two studies I felt that our developers would greatly benefit from detailed mockups showing the layout aswell as the interactions. I got an extra two days approved by the client and we used the expanded mockups in conjunction with a requirements list to define the final scope of the proof of concept.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>The most challenging part about this project was the very short time frame that forced us to realy focus on this one project and work some night shifts too. This is rather unusual as most client's project managers have other duties aswell and thus can't put such a concentrated effort into a single project. It definitly helped that we had a great C-Level commitment and they were realy supportive in getting us the users we needed in such a short time.</p> </div> </article>   <article class=jsd> <header> <figure><img src=images/jsd/jsd.png alt="Department of Justice and Security of Basel-Stadt"></figure> <div class=info> <h3>Department of Justice and Security of Basel-Stadt</h3> <ul class=methods> <li class="method labstudy">Lab Study</li> <li class="method paperprototype">Paper Prototype</li> <li class="method workshops">Workshops</li> </ul> <p class=lead> Before rebuilding their intranet we got commissioned to evaluate the current one in a pre-project and help the IT department plan their approach for a redesign.<br>In this work example I will focus on some detailed findings and how they influenced the proposed solution. <a href=# class=more>read more</a> <a href=# class=less>read less</a> </p> </div> </header> <div class=d-etails> <h4>Assignment</h4> <p> Our client is a canton department (canton is what we call a state in Switzerland) that has several divisions, which again have a hand full of sub-sections. Most of them operate semi-autonomous where they do get general governance and best practices but the implementation is mostly left to the departments. This was very obvious on the old intranet as the quality of content ranged from almost blank pages to really helpful and graphically enhanced sites. Our job was to create a report for the c-level management and consult them on how to build a new and usable intranet. </p> <p>We agreed on doing a Lab Study on the old intranet, draw a prototype and then test it. I did a quick post study interview and label test. Finally I conducted an expert Review. The budget for this project was roughly two weeks. </p><h4>Information Architecture</h4> <p>Most of the users with more than a year on the job had a general idea of what information and documents the different departments and sections provided. Based on this finding it made sense to keep using an organisational structure to organize data as this was the most natural to the involved users. The problem was the absence of a consistent site structure across the different divisions thus making it hard to know the exact location where documents could be found. This lead to users saving templates locally or asking colleagues for information.</p> <p>Besides lacking a consistent structure the document type categories where ambiguous. In the old intranet the most common ones where directives, guideline, form, resources, processes and check lists. These labels posed several problems: <ol> <li>None of the test participants could tell the difference between <strong>directive, guideline and forms</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Process</strong> was correctly attributed to some form of operation or action, but it was unclear if this would be a diagram showing the process, a checklist that helps getting all requirements of a given process, a documentation helping to apply the process or a workflow that could be started by filling out a form.</li> <li><strong>Ressources</strong> was generally unknown when asked the open question what it might be. Once we asked what the category for meeting rooms or equipment would be named all participants responded with "resources". The conclusion is that the term simply isn't used yet in the clients jargon. As they were about to introduce MS Outlook as their new email tool before the intranet launched we advised to keep this label for meeting rooms and equipment. The reason being that those items will be labelled Resources in Outlook and users will directly make reservations in their calendar as needed. We expect users to get comfortable with this new term fairly quickly.</li> </ol> </p> <p>This is the simplified site structure we came up with for each divisions and sections site:</p> <ul> <li><strong>[Division Name]</strong> the landing page of the respective division or section</li> <li><strong>Documents</strong> contains a list of all documents with quick views on categories directives, forms and check lists</li> <li><strong>Process</strong> has a short explanatory text and two links: <ol> <li>Provis (third party process management tool containing the Visio process maps)</li> <li>Link to the checklist view on the document library</li> </ol> A workflow platform was planned but not in the scope of this redesign. Once this platform is live users will be able to start workflows from this page. </li> </ul> <h4>Personas</h4> <p>The two main personas are called "internal" and "external" meaning they are of the same division as the page they are looking at. Both have different expectations on what the intranet should provide.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Division internal</strong> users have in-depth knowledge of the available documents and workflows offered by their division and will mostly work directly on the document library. As they tend to use a hand full of templates over and over again we offer them a way to favourite documents.</li> <li><strong>Division external</strong> users on the other hand have rather shallow knowledge of what available documents exist and only a general idea of where the document could be located or what the exact name is. They need assistance in finding what they are looking for.</li> </ul> <p>In the next two examples I would like to demonstrate to you how this affected the final outcome.</p> <h4>Division home page</h4> <p> The landing page of each division or sub division acts as an informational starting point and is primarily optimized for external uses. (Internal ones will skip this page and go directly to their document library). It provides answers to the most important questions an external user may have.</p> <figure> <img src=images/jsd/homepage.png> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <ol> <li><strong>What service does this division provide?</strong><br> In a brief text the division introduces itself. All sub-sections in the text are directly linked to the respective landing page. This is something we added after observing a user trying to click on one of the sub-sections. It is a small detail but it adds to the convenience of using the intranet.</li> <li><strong>What are the most used artefacts?</strong><br> Each division can provide up to six or seven links to their most important assets. This could be any content like documents, workflows or forms.</li> <li><strong>Where can I get help?</strong><br> If the user is uncertain where to find the desired information they can quickly see who the main contact for that division is.</li> <li><strong>What is new?</strong><br> News can be published per division or for the whole department. If there are any specific news for this division, the latest are shown here. (for example when the fire department has bought new trucks)</li> </ol> <h4>Personal Cockpit</h4> <p>This is default browser home page that will be set by IT for every employee. It is not the home page of the intranet however.</p> <figure> <img src=images/jsd/cockpit.png> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <ol> <li>The left column is the "<strong>me column</strong>": First is a customizable list that shows the favourited content. The user can add any links they want. Second and third is an overview of all collaboration workspaces and workflows where the user is part of. The main <strong>persona</strong> for this is the <strong>internal</strong> as this is granting quick access to well-known content.</li> <li><strong>Live search</strong> is directly integrated into the dashboard</li> <li>A list of <strong>most used documents and forms</strong> of the entire department is the default search results shown before the user enters a query. These documents will most likely be HR or IT related. This part of the dashboard is related to the <strong>external persona</strong> and helps discover content.</li> <li>A widget shows the documents the user has <strong>recently edited</strong>. This is mainly for the internal persona so they can get back to where they left yesterday.</li> <li>The <strong>news column</strong> is used for both top down communication as well as news from within the divisions.</li> </ol> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>In the final report the issues with the highest priority where <strong>rather soft skills</strong>. Things like change management and user on boarding, or committing to the intranet as an important tool and dedicating resources to that. Without a doubt the "technical" proposals like the new cockpit are important too, but without the c-level commitment to build and keep the intranet up to date the new intranet will not succeed.</p> </div> </article>           </section>   <section class=waypoint id=quotes> <h2>Quotes</h2> <p>Here are some quotes from people I worked with over the last two and a half years.</p> <div class=clients> <h3>Clients</h3> <blockquote> <p>The workshops where very well conducted and the results prove that it was well worth the effort.

As I'm the only one doing this sort of work my responsibilities range from <strong>producing custom Designs</strong> in Photoshop to <strong>planning and facilitating UX studies and workshops</strong> with our clients and introducing and <strong>establishing the UX principles</strong> with the various stakeholders within our company.</p> <p>I've been floating through the web cosmos since the age of 14 (that's more than half of my life) as a graphic designer, front and backend developer and currently as a UX specialist. Throughout my career I've been interested in building easy to use products and prioritizing the user's needs.</p> <p>Back in the days that was an unusual view as things just had to work to be approved by clients. So once UX gained traction I finally found a name (or methodology) to express my desires and since I have focused on this creative yet analytic discipline.</p> <p>On a more personal note: I'm married to my lovely Wife Silvia and I'm a father of two sweet little princesses. I try to spend most of my free time with them and together we enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/overlandfamily/" target=_blank>exploring Switzerland<i class="fa fa-instagram icon"></i></a>.
