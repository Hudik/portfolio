The first requirement for a great user experience is to meet the exact needs for the usage of a product or a service, without fuss or bother. To achieve this, users must have all necessary information for their task without being overloaded, not having unnecessary actions, calculation or having to recall. Interaction techniques must be familiar and behave along expectation, errors must be prevented. If users make errors, there must be easy way to recover them.</p> <h4>Wireframes</h4> <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups of how the screen estate could be used.</p> <figure> <img src=http://dummyimage.com/600x300> <figcaption>These very low-fi wireframes show a possible layout concept.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Wireframes</h4> <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups of how the screen estate could be used.</p> <figure> <img src=http://dummyimage.com/600x300> <figcaption>These very low-fi wireframes show a possible layout concept.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Wireframes</h4> <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups of how the screen estate could be used.</p> <figure> <img src=http://dummyimage.com/600x300> <figcaption>These very low-fi wireframes show a possible layout concept.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Final Deliverable</h4> <p>From the initial requirements and our kick off meeting I created some very basic mockups of how the screen estate could be used.</p> <figure> <img src=http://dummyimage.com/600x300> <figcaption>These very low-fi wireframes show a possible layout concept.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src=http://dummyimage.com/600x300> <figcaption>These very low-fi wireframes show a possible layout concept.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src=http://dummyimage.com/600x300> <figcaption>These very low-fi wireframes show a possible layout concept.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </article>   <article class=mueag> <header> <figure><img src=http://dummyimage.com/200x200 alt="Alfred Müller AG"></figure> <div class=info> <h3>Alfred Müller AG</h3> <ul class=methods> <li class="method fieldstudy">Fieldstudy</li> <li class="method paperprototype">Paper Prototype</li> <li class="method wireframes">Wireframes</li> <li class="method mockups">Mockups</li> <li class="method personas">Personas</li> <li class="method workshops">Workshops</li> </ul> <p class=lead> As part of a PoC for a DMS (Document Management System) I conducted a field study that surfaced very unexpected findings.

As I'm the only one doing this sort of work my responsabilities range from <strong>producing custom Designs</strong> in Photoshop to <strong>planning and facilitating UX studies and workshops</strong> with our clients and introducing and <strong>establishing the UX principles</strong> with the various stakeholders within our company.</p> <p>I've been floating through the web cosmos since the age of 14 (that's more then half of my life) as a graphic designer, front- and backend developer and recently as the UX lead. Throughout my career I've been interested in building easy to use products and prioritizing the user's needs. Back in the days that was an unusual view as things just had to work to be approved by clients. So once UX gained traction I finally found a name (or methodology) to express my desires and since have focused on this creative yet analytic discipline.</p> <p>On a more personal note: I'm married to my lovely Wife and a father of two sweet little princesses.
